How to implement the application on your server.

What do i need?
- A web server with http or https. If you work locally you can use XAMPP or
similar.
- An account at developer.accuweather.com.
- An APIKEY from developer.accuweather.com. You can get it for free but
with limited usage. Consult documentation to know what the limitations are and
how to get the APIKEY.
- A text editor.

How do I set up the application?
- Open the index.html file with a text editor and modify the <title> and
<header> as you see fit, as well as anything you want to change.
- Open the js/weather.js file and modify:
   - city_code for the locality that wants to see the weather forecast.
   - api_key for which he has succeeded at developer.accuweather.com
   - language for the language in which you want the application to work.
   - metric set true if you want to use the decimal or false metric system
    otherwise.
   - production set the value to 1 when you want to use the application in
     production. If you set any other value the application will read a local
     json test file.

How do I get the city code?
Go to accuweather.com and search for a location. Look at the numeric code that
appears in the URL of your browser. This code is the locality code.
